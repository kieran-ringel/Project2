"""This method implements KMeans clustering. First k clusters is initialized to
the square root of the number of observations. This is a tunable parameter. Then,
random data points are assigned for centroids. Following this, each data point
is clustered around a centroid. The the average is calculated from those clusters.
Average values for each feature are computed and the new centroid is returned. Or
the row value that is most similar to the average. This is done for every cluster.
New centroids and clusters are calculated until the centroids no longer change.
However, since this may make our algorithm run for far too long, a cap of 10
repitions was implemented. """
